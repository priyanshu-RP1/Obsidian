## 📝 What are Comments?  
- **Comments** are pieces of text in your code that are **ignored by JavaScript**.  
- They are used only for **humans (programmers)** to understand the code.  
- Helpful for:  
  - Explaining logic  
  - Making notes for future reference  
  - Documenting your code

## 🔥 Types of Comments in JavaScript  

### 1️⃣ Single-line Comments  
- Start with `//` (two forward slashes).  
- Anything after `//` on that line is ignored by JS.  

```js
// This is a single-line comment
console.log(8 + 7, "here addition"); // here we did addition
````

👉 Output:

```
15 'here addition'
```

### 2️⃣ Multi-line Comments

- Start with `/*` and end with `*/`.
    
- Useful when you want to write notes over multiple lines.
    

```js
/* This is a 
   multi-line comment 
   explaining the code below */
console.log("Hello, Ranjan!");
```

## 💡 Why Use Comments?

- To **explain complex code**.
    
- To **leave reminders** for yourself or your team.
    
- To **temporarily disable (comment out)** a piece of code without deleting it.
    

Example:

```js
// console.log("This line won't run now");
console.log("Only this will run");
```
